            <p>Security is a state of well-being of information and infrastructures in which the possibility of
                successful yet undetected theft, tampering, and disruption of information and services are kept low or
                tolerable</p>

            <p>The Ping of Death is a large ICMP packet sent by a workstation to a target. The target receives the ping
                in fragments and starts reassembling the packet. The size of the packet, once it is reassembled, is too
                big for the buffer and overflows it. This causes unpredictable results, such as reboots or system hangs.
                Early implementations of TCP/IP were (could be) affected. Now, firewalls etc. could filter out such
                packets.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Related terms: Cipher - A secret or disguised way/method of writing.</li>
            </ul>

                Encipher- Convert a message/text into a coded form (encrypt).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;Although in the past cryptography referred only to 'encryption' and 'decryption' of messages with
                secret 'keys', today it is defined as involving mechanisms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Symmetric-key encipherment.</li>
                <li>Asymmetric-key encipherment.</li>
                <li>Hashing.</li>
                <li>Digital Signatures.</li>
                <li>Digital Certificates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;While the use of cryptography for providing 'confidentiality' is typically expected, cryptographic
                techniques are inextricably woven into 'authentication', 'message integrity', 'nonrepudiation', and
                more.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong><u>Symmetric-key encipherment</u></strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both
                the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical, or there may be
                a simple transformation to go between the two keys.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 01 : Symmetric Encryption</em></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>There are two broad classes of symmetric encryption techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Block ciphers - process messages in blocks, process the input one block of elements (e.g., a block =
                    64 bits) at a time, producing an output block for each input block.</li>
                <li>Stream ciphers - process the input elements (e.g., element= a byte or a bit or units larger than a
                    byte) continuously, producing output one element at a time, as it goes along. A typical stream
                    cipher encrypts plaintext one byte at a time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Block ciphers</strong></p>
            <p>The simplest approach to multiple-block encryption is known as electronic codebook (ECB) mode, in which
                plaintext is handled 'b' bits at a time. Each block is encrypted using the same algorithm and the same
                encryption key (K).</p>

            <p style="width:100%"><img src="img/ECB mode.png" alt="" /></p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 02 : ECB mode</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>Modes in Block Cipher</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><u>ECB mode</u></em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>ECB mode stands for Electronic Code Block Mode. It is one of the simplest modes of operation. In this
                mode, the plain text is divided into a block where each block is 64 bits. Then each block is encrypted
                separately. The same key is used for the encryption of all blocks. Each block is encrypted using the key
                and makes the block of ciphertext.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><u>CBC Mode</u></em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>CBC Mode stands for Cipher block Mode at the sender side; the plain text is divided into blocks. In this
                mode, IV(Initialization Vector) is used, which can be a random block of text. IV is used to make the
                ciphertext of each block unique.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><u>CFB Mode</u></em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>CFB mode stands for Cipher Feedback Mode. In this mode, the data is encrypted in the form of units where
                each unit is of 8 bits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><u>OFB mode</u></em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>OFB Mode stands for output feedback Mode. OFB mode is similar to CDB mode; the only difference is in CFB,
                the ciphertext is used for the&nbsp;next stage of the encryption process, whereas in OFB, the output of
                the IV encryption is used for the next stage of the encryption process.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em><u>CTR Mode</u></em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>CTR Mode stands for counter mode. As the name is counter, it uses the sequence of numbers as an input for
                the algorithm. When the block is encrypted, to fill the next register next counter value is used.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Stream ciphers</strong></p>
            <p>It typically encrypts plaintext one byte at a time. A stream cipher eliminates the need to pad a message
                to be an integral number of blocks. A key (K) is input to a pseudorandom bit generator that produces a
                stream of 8-bit random numbers (unpredictable without knowledge of the input key). keystream (output) is
                combined one byte at a time with the plaintext stream using the bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR) operation.

                <li><strong><u>Public Key Cryptography</u></strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Public-key cryptography, or&nbsp;asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs
                of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_key">keys</a>:&nbsp;<em>public
                    keys</em>&nbsp;(which may be known to others), and&nbsp;<em>private keys</em>&nbsp;(which may never
                be known by any except the owner). The generation of such key pairs depends on&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic">cryptographic</a>&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms">algorithms</a>&nbsp;which are based on&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical">mathematical</a>&nbsp;problems termed&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function">one-way functions</a>. Effective security
                requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising
                security.</p>
            <p>Algorithms used in public key encryption:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>RSA</li>
                <li>Diffie-Hellman algorithm</li>
                <li>Elliptic Curve Diffie&ndash;Hellman (ECDH)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em><u>RSA</u></em></p>
            <p>The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. The public key
                consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers. And private key
                is also derived from the same two prime numbers. So, if somebody can factorize the large number, the
                private key is compromised. Therefore, encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double
                or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically
                1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future. But
                till now it seems to be an infeasible task.</p>

            <p><em><u>Diffie-Hellman algorithm</u></em></p>
            <p>The Diffie&ndash;Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each

            <p>Data integrity or integrity refers to the trustworthiness of data or resources in terms of preventing

                assurance of the origin of information. These types of security services could be implemented using Hash
                functions.</p>
            <p>A&nbsp;cryptographic hash function&nbsp;is an algorithm that takes an arbitrary amount of data
                input&mdash;a credential&mdash;and produces a fixed-size output of enciphered text called
                a&nbsp;hash&nbsp;value, or just &ldquo;hash.&rdquo; That enciphered text can then be stored instead of
                the password itself, and later used to verify the user.</p>

            <p><strong>Can Sri Lanka glean any insights to digital security based on the</strong> <strong>experience of
                    Singapore?</strong></p>
            <p>When considering the situation happen in Singapore (DDoS attack),that lesson can be apply to Sri Lankan
                digital security industry. So, let&rsquo;s look at how it can be apply to protect Sri Lankan digital
                security.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Protect from Ping of Death (PoD) attacks</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This type of DDoS attack is based on Application layer.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>CAPTCHAs</em></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>&rdquo;<em>CAPTCHA</em>&rdquo; also known as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Completely Automated Public Turing test to
                tell Computers and Humans Apart is one of the proposed security technique to protect PoD attacks.
                Basically by this CAPTCHA puzzle, there is a challenge-response as attempt to ensure that the response
                given by a human or not (by machine).So the any user that use the server machine(related to DDoS
                attack)must successfully solve the CAPTCHA before that user establishing a TCP connection with that
                server machine.</p>

            <p><strong>&nbsp;<img style="width:100%" src="img/Example of CAPTCHA.png" alt="" /></strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 06 : Example of CAPTCHA</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But there are some problems with this CAPTCHA,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There must be a patience for users (CAPTCHA test are less user friendly)</li>
                <li>Some spammers use real users to solving CAPTCHA giving small amount of money</li>
                <li>There are some image recognition techniques used to bread CAPTCHAs by present</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Because of those problems of CAPTCHAs, it was not using present</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>ConnectionScore scheme</em></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this method basically, the server can measure different, different statistical attributes for its
                users and also their traffic during the normal condition (which there is no attack against). So, by
                that, the server can use that information as a reference to when an attack happens. This ConnectionScore
                scheme predicts the legitimacy of connections with high amount of probability. Considering attributes
                can be given as below,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request rate and download rate</li>
                <li>Uptime and downtime</li>
                <li>Browsing behavior</li>
                <li>Source IP address distribution</li>
                <li>Arrival distribution rate of users</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li><strong>Protect from SMURF attacks</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This type of DDoS attack is based on Network layer. Below techniques can be used to prevent from SMURF
                attacks,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deploy scrubbing or inline DDoS mitigation technology</li>
                <li>Blocking directed broadcast traffic that coming into the network</li>
                <li>Disable IP broadcast addresses at each network router and firewall</li>
                <li>Use Cloudflare&rsquo;s DDoS protection</li>

            <p><strong><u>CONCLUSION</u></strong></p>
            <p>As Sri Lankans there some basic ways for handle with digital security (these are common ways, not only
                focus on Singapore attack). Those can be given as below,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure to implement regular back-ups of important business data and information</li>
                <li>Make sure to download and install software updates and patches for the Operating Systems and
                    applications that use. Because those updates ensure the secure configuration of all of the
                    users&rsquo; systems</li>
                <li>Use a good antivirus software</li>
                <li>Put good passwords to user accounts (also it&rsquo;s good if change the password time to time)</li>
                <li>Assist with establishing a robust incident response and disaster recovery plan should the worst
                    should happen</li>
                <li>Constant monitoring of user&rsquo;s networks</li>
                <li>Secure mobile working by develop a mobile device action plan and install encryption and mobile
                    device management</li>
                <li>Be cautious of suspicious links (from websites or coming to email)</li>
                <li>Reduce to use debit cards online (also make sure to prevent from saving the payment information)
                </li>
                <li>Avoid entering from unknown websites</li>
                <li>Be aware of sharing things in social media</li>
                <li>Avoid unnecessary downloads</li>
            </ul>
